# RecipABCD
Best reciprocal hits for 4 data sets


#This script will calculate best reciprocal hits between 4 species.

#to run the script you'll need reciprocal hits for four samples calculated with the scripts in "http://archive.sysbio.harvard.edu/CSB/resources/computational/scriptome/UNIX/Protocols/Sequences.html". You will be asked to provide them when the script starts. Also, you'll need a file with a list of headers from samples A and B, with names "listA" and "listB" in the same folder you are running the script. Headers will have to be without ">" in the beggining.
#After the script finishes, you will find a folder named "results" with respective reciprocal hits and a csv table with final numbers.
